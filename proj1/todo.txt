- max 6 chars (file max size 64GB lmao)

replicationdeg:
- max 9: ignorar as malformed e limitar os args no RMI

chunk size: 64KByte

todo: move chunk_no to children or intermediate abstract?

todo: discuss stringbuilder to string? (MessageFactory)

todo: delete must also look at the peer's own files lol <- Very easy but important

todo: consider protocol version and other things like that in message parsing (body is after last CRLF, for example - Reverse array percorrating?)
