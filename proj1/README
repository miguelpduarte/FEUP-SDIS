To build and run the project, a set of scripts were developed.

To build the project:
./build.sh
This script makes use of the build_peer.sh (that builds the peer app) and the build_testapp (that builds the test app) scripts.

To lauch multiple peers at the same time:
./start_peers.sh <num_peers>
This script allows the following flags:
-k | --kill       -> kill running peers on startup (if existant)
-b | --basic      -> peers using basic protocols version 1.0 (default is enhanced 2.1)
-s | --start-id   -> specify the starting peer id (default is 0)
-t | --tile       -> enable tiling mode (if using i3 window manager)

To kill all running peers:
./kill_peers.sh

To run the a test app:
./run.sh <peer_id> <protocol_method> (<protocol_arg>)*
