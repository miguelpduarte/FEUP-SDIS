To build and run the project, a set of shell scripts were developed.

To build the project:
./build.sh
This script makes use of the build_peer.sh (that builds the peer app) and the build_testapp.sh (that builds the test app) scripts.

To lauch multiple peers at the same time:
./start_peers.sh <num_peers>

This script also accepts the following flags (they may be in any order, given that the argument of a flag must follow the flag):
-k | --kill       -> kill running peers on startup (if existent)
-b | --basic      -> peers are launched using protocol version 1.0 - the provided specification (the default is the enhanced version, 2.1)
-s | --start-id   -> specify the starting peer id (default is 0); The following argument is the value of the starting peer identifier
-t | --tile       -> enable tiling mode (only possible when using i3 window manager); May accept a number as the next argument that is the number of columns to tile into
-r | --remove     -> removes the previous stored peer files - backed up chunks, restored files and serialized stored data (.sdis files)

To kill all running peers:
./kill_peers.sh

To run the a test app:
./run.sh <peer_id> <protocol_method> (<protocol_arg>)*
Where peer_id is the bound RMI name of the desired peer
(Note: start_peers.sh automatically prefixes the peer id number with "Peer-". So, the peer with id 0 would be bound as "Peer-0")

Examples:
To launch 5 peers in the enhanced mode, killing the previously running peer processes and emptying the data stored in disk:
    ./start_peers.sh -k -r 5
Afterwards, to have Peer 1 run an enhanced backup for the file "test.txt" with a replication degree of 3:
    ./run.sh Peer-1 BACKUPENH test.txt 3


Notes:
In order to run the project, a Java version of 8 or higher is necessary.
In order to build the project, the jdk bundled version of javac can be used.
